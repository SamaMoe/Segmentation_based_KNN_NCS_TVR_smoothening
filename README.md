# Segmentation_based_KNN_NCS_TVR_smoothening
Segmentation based k-nearest neighbours, natural cubic splines and total variation regularization for automated chromatogram smoothening

This repository comprises 4 jupyter notebooks (k-nearest neighbours, natural cubic splines, total variation regularization and Savitzky-Golay). Each notebook describes the chromatogram segmentation and the automated parameter tuning based on the Durbin-Watson criterion for the four beforementioned smoothing methods. An application example on an experimental chromatogram is included in each notebook.
